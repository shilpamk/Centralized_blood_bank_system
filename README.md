# Centralized_blood_bank_system

This database serves as a link between blood banks, hospitals and donors, allowing patients to quickly and easily find the blood that they need. 

Each city will have a main blood bank and all the hospitals in that city will have easy access. 

This main blood bank will be the center point to all the hospitals in the city.

Donors donate to Hospitals and excess blood will be sent to main blood bank.
